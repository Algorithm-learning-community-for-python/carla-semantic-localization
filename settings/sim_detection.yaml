## Defines parameters for simulated detecion

# Road surface stop signs
# RSStopDetectionSimulator uses a underlying RSStopGTExtractor to get the ground truth of road surface stop signs (rs stop sign),
# then add noise to simulate rs stop detections. Thus, configurations for the gt extractor must be set.

# RS stop sign ground truth extractor
rs_stop:
  rs_stop_gt_extractor:
    radius: 30                     # (m) Search radius for road surface stop sign actors
    max_lateral_offset: 1.75       # (m) Max lateral offset within which the sign can be extracted
    max_yaw_diff: 0.18             # (rad) Max heading difference within which the sign can be extracted
    
  # Scale longitudinal distance to simulate error
  scale: 1.0
  # Mean parameter in the noise model for longitudinal distance.
  noise_bias: 0.0
  # Standard deviation parameter in the noise model for longitudinal distance.
